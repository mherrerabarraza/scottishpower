# Hybrid Search API for Magazine Data

This project implements an API with one endpoint to perform a hybrid search in a table of 1 million records. The hybrid search combines keyword-based and vector-based searches, providing both types of results. The data model consists of two tables: one containing the main information of a magazine and the other containing all the content of the magazine.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Python 3.9
- OpenAI API key (Provided)
- PostgreSQL GUI client (DBeaver, PGAdmin, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. Create a copy of `example.env.docker` and rename it to `.env`.
2. Open `.env` and fill in the OpenAI API key (provided), leaving everything else unchanged.
3. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

4. Go to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) to view the API documentation and run queries.

## Data Model

This solution is based on a magazine database with two tables:

- **Table 1: Magazine Information**
  - Fields: `id`, `title`, `author`, `publication_date`, `category`, etc.
- **Table 2: Magazine Content**
  - Fields: `id`, `magazine_id` (foreign key to Magazine Information), `content`, `vector_representation`, etc.

The table structure for vector search is enhanced with OpenAI embeddings, resulting in:

- `id`: Generated using `UUID` with the current timestamp (`datetime.now()`).
- `metadata`: Contains the original data such as title, author, category, and publication date.
- `contents`: A processed representation of the original content for keyword search.
- `embeddings`: Vector representations (generated using OpenAI embeddings) of the content.

## How It Works

### Indexing

Two indices are created to optimize search performance:

1. **DiskANN Index** for vector-based searches, allowing fast similarity searches on vector representations (embeddings).
2. **GIN Index** for keyword-based searches, optimizing full-text search queries.

More information on how this indexing improves performance can be found [here](https://www.timescale.com/blog/pgvector-is-now-as-fast-as-pinecone-at-75-less-cost/).

## Hybrid Search

The hybrid search combines both keyword-based and semantic search results. Hereâ€™s how each search works:

### Keyword Search

The keyword search is based on PostgreSQL full-text search functionality, using `ts_vector` and `websearch_to_tsquery`:

```sql
SELECT id, contents, ts_rank_cd(to_tsvector('english', contents), query) as rank
FROM {self.vector_settings.table_name}, websearch_to_tsquery('english', %s) query
WHERE to_tsvector('english', contents) @@ query
ORDER BY rank DESC
LIMIT %s
```

### Semantic Search

The semantic search leverages vector representations (embeddings) generated using OpenAI. It finds records based on vector similarity.

### Combining Results

The hybrid search merges both keyword and semantic search results, removes duplicates, and returns the most relevant results based on ranking.

## Example Query

```bash
GET /search?query=information about Programming
```
